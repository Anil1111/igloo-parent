/**
 * An improved and simplified version of the BindingModel implementation of
 * wicket-bindgen.
 * 
 * It is based on PropertyModel instead of using bindgen features because
 * bindgen behavior is not the same as Wicket one. Typically, when an
 * object is null in the path, Wicket tries to instantiate using the default
 * constructor which allows to have cost().quantity() working even if
 * cost property is null.
