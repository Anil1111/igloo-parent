/**
 * Selects an appropriate localized string based on whether a count value is
 * zero, one or greater than one. This makes it easier to produce singluar and
 * plural phrases.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider the case where we would like to set one of these three
 * feedback messages. Notice how the phrasing is slightly different depending on
 * the number of items. Furthermore in the latter two examples we would like to
 * embed a hyperlink to a bookmarkable page.
 * <ul>
 * <li>There are no friends in your network.</li>
 * <li>There is <u>one friend</u> in your network.</li>
 * <li>There are <u>5 friends</u> in your network.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Normally in Wicket you would accomplish this using tedious if/else statements
 * and string concatenation, conditionally visible fragments/containers, or the
 * incredibly arcane syntax of Java's {@link java.text.ChoiceFormat
 * ChoiceFormat} (and note that you'd have to carefully escape the "&lt;" and
 * "&gt;" if you want to include HTML markup as we need for the hyperlinks in
 * this example). All of these approaches are clumsy, and it would be hard for a
 * non-programmer to localize or edit the strings.
 * <p>
 * You can now use this model in a label (also consider
 * {@link fiftyfive.wicket.basic.CountLabel CountLabel} as a shortcut for this
 * common use case), or call {@link #getObject getObject()} to get the
 * interpolated string value for use in a feedback message.
